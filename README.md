## 📌 Overview

The **Interactive Games Website** is a curated collection of small, browser-based games built entirely with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The project demonstrates core front-end development skills such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic user interface updates. Each game provides a unique interactive experience, allowing users to engage with the web page in real time and receive immediate feedback on their actions.  

This website was designed not only to entertain but also to highlight practical coding skills in a way that is accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences. By creating these small-scale, fully functional games, I was able to reinforce important JavaScript concepts such as conditional logic, loops, and randomization, while also considering usability and visual design. The project serves as a tangible demonstration of my ability to build responsive and interactive front-end applications from scratch.
